# An Analytical Formula Representing Mesophyll Resistance as a Property of a Complex Biophysical, Biochemical, and Anatomical System
Components of mesophyll resistance and their reponses to light and CO<sub>2</sub> are systematically studied using a 3D cell model, a 3D leaf model and an explicit analytical formula.
